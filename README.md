# League of Legends First Turret Analysis and Win Predictor
In this project I analyze a League of Legends(LOL) 2025 dataset from Oracles Elixer. This was conducted as a final project for DSC80 at UCSD focusing on the impact of destroying first turret and how other related features affect the outcome of a game.

# Introduction

League of Legends is a popular multiplayer online battle arena game launched in October 2009 by Riot Games. It has since become one of the most popular multiplayer games and has a big esports scene. The dataset that I worked with contains data from professional esports matches that took place throughout 2025. <br>

This dataset contains key information about each match that was played. The dataset captures the teams and individual players performances, the outcome of the match, and timestamps of certain in-game statistics. 
<br>
In a game of League of Legends, I believe that the team who gets **first tower** gains a significant advantage over the other. Destroying first tower opens up the map and allows for more team play, better objective control, and in general allows you to pressure the opponent more. This leads to the main interest of my project, how accurately can we predict the outcome of a game know which team got first tower. Further more I will investigate how much more we can improve this model by including features available to us at the 15 minute mark of a game.
